TERMS OF USE
Effective Date August 20, 2007

Introduction; Consent to Terms

Please read these Terms of Use before using the mobile sites of NPR and its member stations, NPR's interactive voice response (IVR) service, or any features of the sites or the service, including, but not limited to, the Station Finder and making donations to NPR member stations (collectively, the "Mobile Service"). By using the Mobile Service, you agree to be bound by these terms of use. If you do not agree to these terms of use, please exit the Mobile Service. We reserve the right, at our discretion, to modify, add or delete portions of these terms at any time by posting updated terms of use on our mobile site. Please check these terms frequently for updates. Any modifications, additions or deletions to these terms shall be effective immediately upon posting of updated terms of use. Your continued use of the Mobile Service following the posting of updated terms of use will mean that you agree to those changes.

Charges for the Mobile Service
NPR does not charge you to use the Mobile Service; please check your wireless plan, however, because your carrier's per-minute, text messaging, and data or other charges may apply.  You must provide at your own expense the equipment and wireless connections needed for you to use the Mobile Service, and you are solely responsible for any costs you incur to access the Mobile Service.  You should keep in mind that the use of the Mobile Service to send content to another person via e-mail or SMS (Short Message Service, or "text messaging") may result in wireless charges to both the sender and the receiver. 

Donations

The features that allow you to make donations to NPR member stations through the Mobile Service are operated by NPR's third party service providers.  For information on the collection and use of personally identifying information through these features, please see our Privacy Policy.
